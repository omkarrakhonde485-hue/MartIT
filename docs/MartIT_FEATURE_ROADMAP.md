# MartIT — Feature Roadmap & Implementation Guide

**Purpose:** This is the authoritative feature backlog for MartIT. Use it to assess what exists, finish incomplete high-priority functionality, and implement genuinely missing features in priority order. The goal is a reliable campus grocery delivery product for customers, stores, runners, and admins.

**Status:** ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION & VERIFICATION LEDGER

## Guide for the coding agent

1. Read `docs/FINAL_PRODUCT_PLAN.md` first, then this file and the relevant implementation/docs.
2. Inspect the repository, current branch, working tree, architecture, scripts, and tests. Preserve unrelated user changes.
3. Classify each feature as `VERIFIED`, `IMPLEMENTED — NEEDS VERIFICATION`, `MISSING`, `NOT NOW`, or `BLOCKED — USER ACTION REQUIRED`.
4. Do not stop after an audit. After a short baseline check, start implementing the highest-priority actionable gaps.
5. Work in dependency order. Make small changes, test each change, fix regressions, and commit each completed milestone automatically.
6. Update this file's status and progress log with concise evidence, test results, and commit SHA after each milestone.
7. Continue autonomously through independent tasks. Ask only when genuinely blocked by access or approval the user alone can provide.
8. Do not create duplicate planning documents, repeat completed audits, or rebuild working functionality without a demonstrated defect.
9. If code might be used dynamically or externally, preserve it until safe removal or replacement is proven.
10. At completion, summarize implementation, verification, tests/build, commits, and exact user actions remaining.

## Strict safety and architecture rules

- Preserve the agreed **Make.com + Gmail notification-source payment verification workflow**. Do not add Paytm gateway/API integration or SMS OTP.
- Opening a UPI app or returning from it is never proof of payment. Never mark orders paid without the existing trusted server-side verification flow.
- HTTP 200 alone never means payment success. Preserve safe handling of positive, negative, malformed, unknown, timeout, network-error, and unconfigured webhook outcomes.
- Preserve current pricing, whole-rupee base calculation, dynamic platform-fee suffix range/allocation/release timing, distance-based delivery fee, night surcharge, and checkout totals.
- Preserve the existing four-role design, permissions, order lifecycle, inventory reservation/release/expiry, atomic runner acceptance, store pickup ownership checks, in-app delivery OTP protections, and exactly-once delivery completion.
- Do not change schema, apply migrations, alter live data, create real accounts, grant roles, change production settings, make real payments, push, merge, or deploy without explicit authorization.
- Never expose or commit secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys, `.env` files, or secret-bearing webhook URLs.
- Prefer targeted changes. No broad refactors, framework migrations, dependency upgrades, or unrelated redesigns.
- Do not mark features complete based only on mocks or placeholder screens if live integration remains unverified. Clearly distinguish automated evidence from hosted end-to-end evidence.

## Priority definitions

- **P0 — Launch reliability:** essential for trustworthy ordering, payment, fulfillment, and safe role operations.
- **P1 — Daily usability:** removes recurring friction for customers and operators.
- **P2 — Growth/optimization:** only after P0 is reliable and P1 is substantially complete.

## Progress log

- **2026-10-24 | Milestone 1 — Admin Orders Command Center, Payment Exceptions & Customer Reorder:**
  - Admin All-Orders Backend: Implemented `handleListOrders` in `server/src/routes/admin.js` (`GET /api/v1/admin/orders` and `POST /admin/orders/list`), strictly enforcing `PERMISSIONS.ORDERS_READ_ALL`. Added filtering by `status`, `paymentStatus`, `storeId`, `runnerId`, and text search.
  - Mock Server Admin Orders & Store Controls: Added `'admin.orders.list'` and `'stores.update'` handlers in `src/services/mockServer/handlers.js` with permission checks and mock database queries.
  - Admin Console UI Expansion: Upgraded `src/pages/admin/AdminConsolePage.jsx` with 4 top-level operational tabs: **People & Roles** (existing user/runner controls), **All Orders & Operations** (searchable orders, status pills, item checklists, pricing breakdown, assigned runners), **Payment Exceptions** (unverified/pending payment tracking, UTR audit, re-check payment, window expiration actions), and **Store & Operations** (one-click store open/pause toggle and integration health checks).
  - Customer Order Actions: Enhanced `src/pages/customer/OrdersPage.jsx` with atomic "Cancel Order" button for `AWAITING_PAYMENT` orders and "Reorder Items" button for delivered/cancelled orders to immediately populate `cartStore`.
  - Automated Verification: Added 7 backend tests in `server/src/__tests__/adminOrders.test.js`, 2 frontend tests in `src/pages/admin/__tests__/adminConsoleOrders.test.jsx`, 2 unit tests in `src/pages/customer/__tests__/customerOrdersActions.test.jsx`, and 2 mockServer tests in `src/services/mockServer/admin.test.js`.
  - Full Regression Suite: 35 test files passed, 668 passed, 1 skipped (0 failures), 13 migrations validated, production build passed.
  - Commit SHA: `9b59f42`.
