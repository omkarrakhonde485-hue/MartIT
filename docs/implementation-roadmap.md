## 1. Executive Summary & Audit Baseline

MartIT is a smart campus grocery delivery platform built with **React 19**, **Vite**, **React Router v7/v8 data router**, **TanStack Query v5**, **Zustand v5**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.

An end-to-end repository audit was executed prior to implementing code changes. Below is the evidence-based assessment of all system capabilities.

### Evidence Classification Legend
1. **Implemented and tested:** Functional logic covered by automated unit/integration tests in the repository.
2. **Implemented only with mock data:** UI & domain services functional in-browser using mock server (`src/services/mockServer/`) and sample datasets.
3. **Partially implemented:** Slices of functionality built; remaining flows or edge-cases incomplete.
4. **Placeholder or not implemented:** Placeholder page (`PhasePlaceholder`), empty directory, or stubs.
5. **Architectural Specification Defined:** Production contract, relational schema, and failure handling formally defined in architecture documents.

## 3. Store Discovery & Confirmed Multi-Store Fulfillment Policy

### Milestone 1 Resolution: Product-First Shopping (Completed)
- Mandatory store selection headers and dropdowns have been removed from the customer catalogue.
- Customers browse, search, and filter the comprehensive campus catalogue across all participating stores simultaneously.
- Individual [`ProductCard`](file:///c:/Users/omkar/OneDrive/Desktop/MyProjects/MartIT/src/components/products/ProductCard.jsx) components clearly display store fulfillment identity as non-blocking informational metadata.
- Product availability, per-store stock limits, and store-closed indicators are evaluated at the individual product level.

### Confirmed Multi-Store Architecture Policy (2026-10-10)
The product owner has confirmed the following multi-store policies, detailed fully in [`docs/backend-architecture.md`](file:///c:/Users/omkar/OneDrive/Desktop/MyProjects/MartIT/docs/backend-architecture.md):
1. **Multi-Store Basket in Single Checkout:** Customers can purchase products originating from multiple distinct campus stores in a single checkout session.
2. **Parent Order & Store Fulfillment Groups:**
   - All items belong to a single parent order (`orders`).
   - Items for each participating store are partitioned into distinct store fulfillment groups (`order_fulfillment_groups`).
   - The parent order owns the combined financial snapshot, payment attempt, and lifecycle.
   - Fulfillment groups preserve store IDs, pickup locations, item snapshots, inventory reservations, pickup progress, and group status (`PENDING` $\to$ `READY_FOR_PICKUP` $\to$ `PICKED_UP`).
3. **Single Runner per Parent Order:** Exactly one runner is assigned to the parent order. The runner visits all participating stores, collects every fulfillment group, and delivers the combined order to the customer.
4. **Single Payable Total & Payment Transaction:**
   - One customer checkout, one combined payable total, and one customer payment transaction.
   - Parent order total = authoritative sum of all item subtotals + one combined delivery fee + one dynamic platform fee.
   - Dynamic platform fee (₹0.01–₹0.99) is allocated once for the parent payment, with atomic reservation and existing 2-min window / 5-min cooldown rules.
5. **Combined Delivery Fee on Complete Multi-Stop Route:**
   - Exactly one delivery fee is charged based on the complete multi-stop route (originating from pickup stops to customer dropoff).
   - Distance must be derived from a real routing service (walking/road), never straight-line estimates or fabricated values.
   - Standard fee tiers apply: ₹10 ($\le 0.5$ km), ₹15 ($\le 1$ km), ₹20 ($\le 2$ km), ₹5 per started km up to 5 km. Routes $> 5$ km are blocked.
   - If the routing provider fails or cannot compute the route reliably, checkout is blocked with an explicit error (fail-closed; zero fee fabrication).
6. **Delivery Handover Invariants:**
   - The parent order cannot advance to `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` until **all** store fulfillment groups are confirmed `PICKED_UP`.
   - Handover requires server-authoritative, rate-limited OTP verification (max 3 failed attempts, 5-minute lockout).

### Safety & Rollout Strategy
- **Baseline Protection:** The existing single-store checkout and in-browser mock server remain fully operational while new backend services are developed.
- **Rollout Boundary:** Multi-store checkout will remain gated behind `FEATURE_MULTI_STORE_CHECKOUT=false` until routing, inventory locking, runner collection, and payment webhook reconciliation are verified end-to-end against a real Supabase PostgreSQL instance.

- [x] **Milestone 5.0: Architecture & Relational Specification:** Comprehensive specification documented in [`docs/backend-architecture.md`](file:///c:/Users/omkar/OneDrive/Desktop/MyProjects/MartIT/docs/backend-architecture.md).
- [x] **Milestone 5.1: Supabase PostgreSQL Schema & Relational Models (Implemented):**
  - Created migrations in `supabase/migrations/`:
    - `20261010000001_initial_schema.sql` (core entities: `profiles`, `user_roles`, `stores`, `locations`, `categories`, `products`, `orders`, `order_fulfillment_groups`, `order_items`, `inventory_reservations`, `platform_fee_reservations`, `payment_records`, `audit_logs`).
    - `20261010000002_platform_fee_functions.sql` (seed 99 platform fee slots, atomic allocation function with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`).
    - `20261010000003_row_level_security.sql` (RLS policies for least-privilege customer, runner, store owner, and admin access).
    - `supabase/seed.sql` (sample campus stores, locations, and catalogue products).
    - Validation script `scripts/validate-migrations.mjs` verifying syntax, structure, and monetary numeric types.
- [x] **Milestone 5.2A: Render Express API Foundation (Implemented):**
  - Implemented Node.js/Express backend in `server/` with:
    - Environment validation via Zod (`server/src/config/env.js`).
    - Security headers (`helmet`), CORS configuration, request logging without sensitive data, rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`).
    - Health and readiness probes (`/healthz`, `/readyz`).
    - Supabase Auth middleware with role resolution and permission enforcement (`server/src/middleware/auth.js`).
    - User profile retrieval (`GET /api/v1/auth/me`, `POST /auth/me`).
    - Catalogue reads (`GET /api/v1/catalogue/products`, `GET /api/v1/catalogue/categories`).
    - Store and location reads (`GET /api/v1/stores`, `GET /api/v1/locations`).
    - Delivery quote endpoint with authoritative fee calculation (`POST /api/v1/delivery/quote`).
    - Authenticated customer order history and order lookup (`GET /api/v1/orders`, `GET /api/v1/orders/:id`, `POST /orders/get`).
    - Admin user listing, runner approval, and role assignment endpoints (`/api/v1/admin/*`).
    - Automated unit and integration test suite: 25 tests passing in Vitest.
    - Render deployment blueprint (`render.yaml`).

  - Connect authoritative routing service (Mapbox Directions / OpenRouteService walking profile).
  - Implement multi-stop waypoint sequencing visiting all stores then customer destination.
  - Apply fee tiers strictly: ₹10 ($\le 0.5$ km), ₹15 ($\le 1$ km), ₹20 ($\le 2$ km), ₹5 per started km up to 5 km; $>5$ km blocked.
  - Enforce fail-closed handling: return HTTP 503 if routing fails, never fabricate distance/fee.
  - Persist route distance, stop sequence, routing provider, and fee policy version with each order.
- [ ] **Milestone 5.3: Server-Authoritative Multi-Store Order Creation:**
  - Implement `POST /api/v1/orders/create-multistore` in Render Node.js/Express.
  - Enforce idempotency via unique `idempotency_key`.
  - Transactional inventory lock across all participating stores (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`); abort transaction if any store item is insufficient.
  - Atomic dynamic platform fee reservation (₹0.01–₹0.99) with 2-min window / 5-min cooldown.
  - Atomic insertion of parent order and store fulfillment groups.
- [ ] **Milestone 5.4: Single Runner Multi-Group Pickup Lifecycle & Delivery OTP Handover:**
  - Implement `POST /api/v1/runner/orders/:id/pickup-group` updating store fulfillment group status.
  - Enforce delivery gatekeeper invariant: parent order cannot transition to `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` until all associated store groups are `PICKED_UP`.
  - Implement `POST /api/v1/runner/orders/:id/verify-handover` with hashed OTP check and rate limiting (max 3 failed attempts).
- [ ] **Milestone 5.5: Multi-Store Failure Handling & Automated Concurrency Tests:**
  - Automated tests covering the 8 failure modes specified in `docs/backend-architecture.md`:
    1. Store closing during checkout (atomic rollback).
    2. Partial stock shortage across stores (atomic multi-store rollback, zero partial holds).
    3. Route calculation failure or route $>5$ km (fail-closed, checkout blocked).
    4. Runner dropout mid-pickup (order re-queued, already-picked-up groups preserved).
    5. Store pickup failure (group marked failed, partial refund compensation).
    6. Payment success followed by fulfillment failure (authoritative refund ledger).
    7. Duplicate checkout requests / retries (idempotency verified).
    8. Expired payment verification window (order expired, fee entered cooldown).
- [ ] **Milestone 5.6: Frontend Multi-Store Cart & Checkout Integration:**
  - Update `src/stores/cartStore.js` to allow items from multiple stores when `FEATURE_MULTI_STORE_CHECKOUT=true`.
  - Update `CartPage.jsx` to render multi-store group subtotals and single combined delivery fee.
  - Enable multi-store checkout in production only after milestones 5.1–5.5 pass against live Supabase PostgreSQL.

## 5. Confirmed Decisions & Open Items

1. **Multi-Store Orders vs Single-Store Cart:** **CONFIRMED (2026-10-10)**. Multi-store checkout confirmed with single parent order, store fulfillment groups, single runner multi-stop pickup, combined route delivery fee, and single customer payment. Detailed architecture in [`docs/backend-architecture.md`](file:///c:/Users/omkar/OneDrive/Desktop/MyProjects/MartIT/docs/backend-architecture.md).
2. **Runner Payout Schedule:** Values for ₹15 (0.5–1 km), ₹20 (1–2 km), ₹25 (2–3 km), ₹30 (3–4 km), ₹35 (4–5 km) delivery fee bands remain provisional (`null`). Internal ledger only, not shown to customers.
3. **Road Routing Provider:** Selection of road/walking routing service (Mapbox Directions API vs OpenRouteService). Must use walking/campus profile with fail-closed error handling.

## 6. Subsystem Status & Rollout Readiness

To ensure transparency and deployment safety, MartIT explicitly distinguishes between three statuses:
- **Implemented in repository:** The code exists and is committed in the codebase.
- **Tested against a real database:** The schema and transactional logic have been executed and tested against an active Supabase PostgreSQL database.
- **Enabled in production:** The feature is live and accessible to end-users in the production deployment.
