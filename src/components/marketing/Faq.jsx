    q: 'What is MartIT?',
    a: 'MartIT is an ordering and delivery platform for closed communities like college campuses, hostels and residential societies. You order essentials from a store that serves your community, and an approved student runner brings them to you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does delivery cost?',
    a: `It depends on the distance from the store to your saved delivery spot: ₹${b1.fee} up to ${b1.maxKm * 1000} m, ₹${b2.fee} up to ${b2.maxKm} km, ₹${b3.fee} up to ${b3.maxKm} km, then ₹${EXTENDED_DELIVERY.perStartedKm} more for every started kilometre after that. We don’t deliver beyond ${MAX_SERVICE_KM} km. You’ll always see the exact fee before you pay.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I pay?',
    a: 'With any UPI app, by scanning the QR code at checkout. Your order is confirmed once the payment is verified by the payment system — tapping “I’ve paid” on its own doesn’t confirm an order.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the delivery code (OTP)?',
    a: 'Each order gets a one-time code. Share it with your runner only when you have your items in hand — the delivery is completed when they enter it. Codes expire and allow a limited number of attempts.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who are the runners?',
    a: 'Students from the community who have been approved by the MartIT team. You can’t pick the runner role when you sign up; runner access is granted after approval.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I track my order?',
    a: 'Yes. You’ll see each stage as it happens: Confirmed, Preparing, Picked up, On the way and Delivered.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who can see my orders?',
    a: 'Only you. The runner assigned to your order sees the details needed to deliver it.',
