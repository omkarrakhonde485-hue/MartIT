/**
 * Mock Verification Adapter (Mock Server).
 *
 * Simulates payment reconciliation and Make.com webhook integration.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL SAFETY GUARANTEES:
 * 1. This is explicitly a MOCK adapter for local development and automated testing.
 * 2. It NEVER automatically marks a payment as PAID simply to make the UI look complete.
 * 3. Only verified server-side evidence ("Payment received") can transition a payment to PAID.
 * 4. The response "not received" is strictly INCONCLUSIVE; it never marks payment failed or paid,
 *    and directs the customer to contact the administrator.
 * 5. Neither QR display, client button clicks, browser redirects, nor elapsed time can mark an order paid.
